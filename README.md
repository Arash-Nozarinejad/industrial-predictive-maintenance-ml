# Industrial Predictive Maintenance

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning system that predicts equipment failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling. We'll use sensor data from industrial equipment to build models that identify patterns preceding failures.

### Business Impact

Manufacturing companies lose $50,000-$100,000 per hour of unplanned downtime. Our predictive maintenance system could reduce these failures by 25-45%, resulting in annual savings of $1-5 million for medium to large manufacturing operations.
